<h2> Summary: </h2>

<p> Draft Buddy is a data science I undertook with a programming partner during the summmer of 2019. Our
  goal was to design a web scraping algorithm which would help a user determine which players to draft in
  the 2019 fantasy football season. We integrated Pythonâ€™s BeautifulSoup, operator, and csv libraries to
  categorize and analyze web-scraped football statistics. Our algorithm then generated a rankings list
  to assist the user in deciding which players to draft based on position.
