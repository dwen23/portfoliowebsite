<h2> Summary: </h2>

<p> Draft Buddy is a data science I undertook with a programming partner during the summmer of 2019. Our
  goal was to design a web scraping algorithm which would help a user determine which players to draft in
  the 2019 fantasy football season. We integrated Pythonâ€™s BeautifulSoup, operator, and csv libraries to
  categorize and analyze web-scraped football statistics. Our algorithm then generated a rankings list
  to assist the user in deciding which players to draft based on position.
  </p><br>
<p>
  Our algorithm took into account a variety of factors when ranking invidual players. We included Playing Time,
Percentage of Snaps Taken, as well as the more traditional stats of Passing Yards, Rushing Yards, Touchdowns, and Receptions.
This is because in Fantasy Football, we stand by the motto "Volume is King", and the more playing time a player gets,
the stronger they'll perform. Our Minimum Viable Product was a Quarterbacks Only ranking system, and we've worked to expand
this to other positions as well. 
  </p></br>
<p> We are looking to improve on a few areas as well. Our algorithm currently only accounts for veterans in the National
  Football League, and we're currently looking for a way to account for rookies entering the league as well. We also 
  are working to identify how offseason personnel changes effect individual player's outputs, as drastic shifts in a team
  can result in variations of individual player performance.
