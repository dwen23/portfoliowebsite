  <div id="About">
    <p> Hi! My name is Derek Wen and I'm a second year student at Northwestern University studying Computer Science
      and pursuing a Certificate of Financial Economics from the Kellogg School of Management. I was born and raised
      in Santa Monica, CA and spent my first year of undergrad at the University of California, San Diego before transfering
      to Northwestern to continue my studies. I have experience coding in Python, Java, C++, as well as the web design languages
      HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
