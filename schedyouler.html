  <h2> Summary: </h2>

  <p> SchedYOUler was a project I undertook at HackSC - USC's annual hackathon as a part of a
    five member team. The goal of SchedYOUler was to create a scheduling website, utilizing Google
    Calendar API to help college students manage their homework load. The user would input their class
    schedule, homework load, and their mental health state on a given day, and SchedYOUler would update
    the user's calendar in response to the input. We utilized Python's pandas library to sort and analyze
    user input as well as Javascript and HTML for front-end website development.
